# Key Features
DBMS project developed using PL/SQL, including various advanced features as collections, cursors, subprograms, functions, packages, and triggers.
# Description
The database model provides specific information for a high school, including the classes it consists of, the teachers who teach within it, the subjects taught, the location of classrooms, the students enrolled in these classes, and their academic status. It facilitates the recording of student grades and absences for particular subjects, capturing the date of assessment or absence, along with any relevant reasons for the absence.

Each student is linked with at least one legal guardian, while tutors may have associations with multiple students enrolled at the high school. Personal details such as names, addresses, and contact information of students, guardians, and teachers are stored within the database. Additionally, records of teacher salaries are maintained.

Each class is assigned with a homeroom teacher and a classroom where specific subjects are taught. Certain subjects may necessitate specialized facilities such as laboratories or sports halls. The schedule encompasses details such as the day and time of classes, the teacher teaching a particular subject for a class, and the assigned classroom.
